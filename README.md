A rather short program that solves the NYT spelling bee [https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee](url) . Wordlist comes from the University of Michigan [https://websites.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html](url) .

It doesn't have any safeguard code in place, but it does a stellar job for when I want to stop being a word-wielder and start being a code-runner.
